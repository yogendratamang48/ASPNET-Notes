## Web Applications Basics
#### Introduction ####  
Web application is an application that can be accessed through web browser or a specialized user agent. a HTTP request is created for specific urls (call for action methods) that map to resources (text file, html file, audio, video etc.). The server renders and returns HTML pages to the client.  
##### HTTP Basics ####  
HTTP is Application Layer Protocol for communicating between distributed systems World Wide Web(WWW) is based on HTTP. It is foundation of any data exchange on the web and a client-server protocol. It Provides standardized way for computers to communicate with each other.HTTP specification specifies how client has to send request and how server should response, thus providing rule for communication
##### HTTP Features: #####  
* **Simple and Human Readable**
* **HTTP Media is independent**  
 Any type of resource can be sent as long as servers and clients know how to handle such resource.
 * **HTTP is stateless**  
 There is no link between two requests being successfully carried out in the same connection.

##### HTTP Transaction #####  
An HTTP Client opens a connection and sends a request to HTTP Server.
The server returns a response message (Response usually contains requested resources). After delivering Request, Server closes the connection. Hence HTTP is called stateless protocol. A round trip, client requesting and server responding is known as HTTP transaction.  
Client and Server communicate eachother by exchanging messages. Message sent by client is called Request, Message sent from the server is known as Response.
